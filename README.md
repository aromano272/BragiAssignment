# Android Clean Architecture App

A modular Android application built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and a clean architecture approach. The project uses modern libraries like Ktor, Koin, Coroutines, and follows principles such as Inversion of Control and a unidirectional data flow (MVI-inspired) in the presentation layer.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

This project is organized into **5 layers** with clear separation of concerns:

```
ui           # Jetpack Compose UI + Navigation
presentation # ViewModels, MVI-esque state handling
domain       # UseCases, domain models, and data layer definitions
data         # Services, network layer definitions
network      # DTO models, Api and Http client
```

### Key Principles:
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain layer is independent of any framework or platform
- **Dependency Inversion**: Interfaces for outer layers are defined within and implemented outside
- **MVI-ish Pattern**: Unidirectional flow in the presentation layer
